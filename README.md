🚀 Exciting Project Completed: Email/SMS Spam Classifier! 📧📲



I'm thrilled to share that I have successfully completed an end-to-end project focused on machine learning and natural language processing: the Email/SMS Spam Classifier. This project has been an incredible learning experience and a great opportunity to apply my skills in a real-world scenario.

 Here are the key steps I followed:

1️⃣ Loading of Data: Acquired and imported the necessary datasets.
2️⃣ Cleaning of Data: Ensured the data was clean and free of inconsistencies. 
3️⃣ Text Preprocessing: Performed essential text preprocessing tasks.
4️⃣ EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Conducted thorough EDA to understand the data better.
5️⃣ Model Building: Built and trained the classifier using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.
To make the project more interactive, I created a Streamlit application, enabling users to easily interact with the model and classify messages as spam or not spam.

This project has strengthened my skills in machine learning, natural language processing, and data analysis. I’m excited to explore more complex projects and contribute to innovative solutions in the field.

Feel free to check out my project and share your thoughts!
